# The Ultimate C Programming Course

It is a C Programming repo that provides organised Chapter wise topics

Each Chapter consists of both program files compiled files
so, please ignore the compiled files (.exe files)

Navigate through each .c file and learn something new

Each comments are done by me with proper placements in the codes and in the respective Chapters

Note: Every Chapter has problems.txt which has problems to solve and the answers are like problem01.c
