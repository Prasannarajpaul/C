1. Create an array of 10 numbers. Verify using the pointer arithmetic that (ptr+2) points to the third element where ptr is a pointer pointing to the first element of the array
2. If S[3] is a 1-D array of integers then *(S+3) refers to the third element:
    a. True
    b. False
    c. Depends
3. Write a program to create an array of 10 integers and store multiplication table 5 in it
4. Repeat problem 3 for general input provided by the user using scanf
5. Write a program containing function which reverses the array passed to 
6. Write a program containing functions which counts the number of positive integers in an array
7. Create an array of size 3x10 containing multiplication tables of the number 2, 7, and 9 respectively
8. Repeat problem 7 for a custom input given by the user
9. Create a three-dimensional array and print the address of its elements in increasing order
